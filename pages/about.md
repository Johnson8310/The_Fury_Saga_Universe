# About the Author

J.C. Johnson is the author of *The Fury Saga*, a supernatural horror thriller series rooted in legacy, consequence, and the idea that some things survive us—waiting to be claimed again.

Drawing from industrial landscapes, forgotten roads, and the quiet weight of inherited mistakes, Johnson writes stories where horror is not sudden, but inevitable.

The Fury Saga blends supernatural horror with grounded realism, focusing on people who work with their hands, live close to the road, and inherit problems they never asked for.

## Why I Wrote *The Fury Saga*

Some stories don’t start with monsters.  
They start with ownership.

*The Fury Saga* was born from a fascination with what people leave behind—machines, property, debt, damage—and how those things continue to move through the world long after their creators are gone.

This series isn’t about outrunning the past.  
It’s about what happens when the past catches up—and the cost of pretending it won’t.
