*Spoiler-Safe Introductions*

In this universe, people don’t just meet fate.  
They inherit it.

## Arlene Cunningway  
**Tag:** Legacy Bearer

Arlene is practical, relentless, and built for hard work—someone who can haul wreckage all day and still sleep with one eye open. She believes in control, in distance, in containment. But the past doesn’t respect boundaries, and what she carries isn’t only history—it’s consequence.

---

## Dee  
**Tag:** The One Who Knew

Dee is the name that lingers in the background like an old warning sign that never stopped being true. She understood the rules early—the kind of understanding that doesn’t come from theory, but from surviving what other people didn’t.

---

## Big Rhon  
**Tag:** The Hauler

A road-hardened presence with a sharp mouth and sharper instincts. Rhon lives in motion—miles, diesel, and deadlines—but she knows when something on the road is wrong. Some headlights don’t belong to any living driver.

---

## Gary  
**Tag:** The Operator

A veteran of the long haul who trades highway life for the weight of running a yard. He’s steady, capable, and familiar with how quickly “normal” can turn. In places built from rust and memory, routine is never a guarantee.

---

## Officer Malone  
**Tag:** The Watcher

A local officer who can feel when a situation is off—even when there’s no proof yet. He’s not chasing ghosts. He’s chasing patterns. And patterns are what curses leave behind.
