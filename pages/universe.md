# The Fury Saga Universe

*Spoiler-Free Lore*

Some legacies are written down.  
Others are forged.

What survives fire remembers the heat.

## The Prophecy

The prophecy was never meant to be guidance.  
It does not warn. It records.

Passed down in fragments, it speaks of bloodlines, steel, and the cost of ownership.  
Every generation believes it can be outrun.

None of them do.

## Blood & Steel

Steel carries memory.

The weight it bore.  
The hands that shaped it.  
The intent behind its use.

Fire does not erase this memory.  
It seals it in.

What is forged with greed does not remain neutral.

## The Rules

There are rules to the Fury Saga.  
They are never explained to the characters—only enforced.

- Fire does not cleanse everything  
- Ownership leaves fingerprints  
- Greed always calls something back  
- Distance is not protection  
- Steel remembers

## Locations

**Detroit**  
Where industry, ambition, and inherited greed first took shape.

**The Gulf Coast**  
Where storms, salt air, and isolation offer the illusion of escape.

Both places are connected by what was moved—  
and what should have been left alone.
