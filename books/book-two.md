# Book Two: Fury

**Status:** Coming Soon

They tried to chain it.  
They tried to move it.  
They were never meant to escape it.

Book Two deepens the mythology of *The Fury Saga*, where storms gather near cursed steel, footprints appear where no one has walked, and the past refuses to stay contained.
