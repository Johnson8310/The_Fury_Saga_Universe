# Book One: Fury

A cursed legacy born in fire and greed refuses to stay buried.

When Arlene Cunningway leaves Detroit behind, she believes distance, chains, and secrecy can contain what her family helped create. She is wrong.

Storms gather where Fury rests. Footprints appear where no one has walked. Steel remembers every hand that dares to claim it.

As old names resurface and buried sins claw back into the light, Arlene is forced to confront the truth: the curse was never tied to a place—it was tied to purpose.
